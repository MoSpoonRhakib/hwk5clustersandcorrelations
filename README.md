Question 1

The time correlation graph shows how similar the state's system is from a time t to a time t + Δt. At higher Δt, the system tend to forget its previous state. This plot can be best described as an exponential decay diagram where it approaches an asymptote as the x-value increases. The final t0 as found to be aproximately 0.4 seconds indicating that the system tends to lose its memory pretty quickly.

I was unable to calculate the uncertainties, but I expect the uncertainty to decrease as Δt increases.


Question 2

I was unable to graph the plots at different sampling rates, since all of the plots overlapped each other 1:1. This is because the sample is done with the same trajectory. I tried fixing this but using different seeds for each sampling, but the graph worsened and still showed that the graphs were the same. 

So the only graph that was shown is for the Δt=1 case. Due to being unable finishing this code, I am unable to compare it to the previous problem


Question 3

The best distribution that was available was for the Δt=1 case. The free energy barrier was shown to be 3.3 units.
